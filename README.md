# CNEP
Constrained Non-Exonic Predictor (CNEP), created and applied to the human genome using over ten thousand features defined from large-scale epigenomic and transcription factor binding data to score the evidence of each base being in a constrained non-exonic element from such data.

CNEP predictions for the human genome (hg19) is available in BigWig format (.bw) [here](https://ernst.cass.idre.ucla.edu/public/CNEP/cnep.bw) or 
in Wig format (.wig) by chromosome [here](https://ernst.cass.idre.ucla.edu/public/CNEP/WIGFILES_BYCHROM/).
